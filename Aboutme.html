       <span style="font-family:'Time New Roman';">My life till now:-</span>
       <span style="font-family:'Time New Roman';">Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (2nd Year) at VIT Vellore. This webpage is part of my Web Programming project, and building it has been a fun and insightful experience.
            I am particularly interested in algorithms, digital electronics, and system design, and I enjoy breaking down complex problems into clear, manageable steps.
            CGPA=9.08

        <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
        <p><span style="background-color:cyan;">Through continuous practice, I have been strengthening my capabilities in:</span></style></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><span style ="background-color:yellowgreen;">Analytical reasoning</span></b> — understanding problems deeply and evaluating solutions logically</li>
            <li><b><span style="background-color:yellowgreen">Algorithmic thinking</span></b> — designing, optimizing, and implementing step-by-step solutions</li>
            <li><b><span style="background-color:yellowgreen">Hardware–software integration</span></b> — connecting digital logic, computer architecture, and programming</li>
            <li><b><span style="background-color: yellowgreen">Mathematical logic</span></b> — applying precision and structured reasoning to technical challenges</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <p><span style="background-color:cyan;">While I have strong technical and analytical abilities, there are certain areas I continue to refine as part of my development:</span></style></p>
        <ul>
        <li><b><span style ="background-color:yellowgreen;">Tendency to focus heavily on details</span></b> — My commitment to accuracy sometimes leads me to spend more time than necessary on fine details, though I am actively working on balancing precision with efficiency.</li>
            <li><b><span style="background-color:yellowgreen">Taking longer to grasp the bigger picture initially</span></b> — Because I prioritize mastering fundamentals, I may take extra time to build a complete understanding before moving ahead.</li>
            <li><b><span style="background-color:yellowgreen">Perfection-driven mindset</span></b> — I aim for clarity and correctness in everything I do, which can make me spend additional time refining work. I am improving at identifying when a task is already at an acceptable standard.</li>
