        <pre><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">            My projects reflect a balance between software engineering and hardware fundamentals. I enjoy translating 
            theoretical concepts into functional systems—whether it’s implementing algorithms, modeling digital circuits, 
            or optimizing data structures. Each project is built with an emphasis on correctness, clarity, and verification, 
            showcasing my commitment to high-quality engineering and continuous learning.</span></pre>

                    <dd><pre><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'";>                Developed an intelligent Bad Posture Detection System designed to monitor user posture in real time 
                and provide corrective alerts to prevent long-term strain or discomfort. The system analyzes body alignment 
                using pattern recognition and predefined posture rules, identifying slouching, neck bending, or asymmetrical 
                sitting positions. It delivers timely feedback to encourage healthy posture habits, improving ergonomics and
                reducing the risk of posture-related issues.
