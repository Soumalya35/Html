        <h4>How I Think and Solve Problems</h4><pre><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'";>I am a structured and analytical problem-solver who values clarity, correctness, and logical thinking. 
I approach every concept by breaking it into simple, understandable steps, learning through real examples,
and validating each detail for accuracy. With a mindset focused on mastery rather than memorization, I
strive to build strong, long-lasting foundations across both software and hardware domains. Driven by
curiosity, precision, and a desire to understand how things truly work beneath the surface, I bring a 
disciplined, depth-oriented perspective to every technical challenge I take on, aiming to create solutions 
that are thoughtful, reliable, and technically sound.
